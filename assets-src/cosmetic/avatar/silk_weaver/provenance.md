# avatar.silk_weaver

Static avatar of set 1 (#172), a painted portrait made with template P-3 of `docs/asset-workflow.md` section 2. Every line below is read from a file or a record, or marked as not done. Recorded on 2026-11-14 while the work was done.

- artSource: ai_assisted
- Authors: W-1 concept generated in the project owner's ChatGPT account on 2026-11-14 by an AI agent (Claude Code) driving the owner's browser. W-3 clean-up and W-5 export by the same agent with `work/silk_weaver_cleanup.py`. No person has done W-3
- Generator: ChatGPT in the browser, Create image tool, model `gpt-image` as named by the C2PA manifest embedded in the concept (below). Account holder: the project owner, own ChatGPT account, the account signed in to Chrome on the owner's computer, whose chat history holds the `tile.sema` conversation. Plan: Free (shown in the account menu on 2026-11-14)
- Terms: OpenAI Terms of Use, `https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/`, not read (RC-1 open for the terms, O-2). The account holder reads the terms in force on 2026-11-14 for the Free plan and records the date here
- Canonical concept: concept/20261114-01.png
- Inputs uploaded to the generator: none; one prompt, one image, no edits, in a new conversation (`chatgpt.com/c/6af83d57...`, titled "Create portrait art" by ChatGPT)
- Prompt: P-3 with the style key of section 2.2 pasted verbatim, quoted below
- Concept against the prompt: Matches the prompt. Not asked for but present: gold earrings with a red stone and a pearl drop, and a red stone brooch at the collar. The headband shows small gold leaves between the pearls.
- Similarity check: not done (RC-3 open, O-7)
- Real-person check (RC-4): not done by a person. The face is semi-realistic, so `docs/art-direction.md` 5.1 makes this check matter; the reviewer confirms it resembles no real person
- Human work: none. Clean-up and export are scripted image operations run by an AI agent, so RC-5 stays open; the master and the script are in `work/`
- Self-check (docs/localization.md 6.1 step 1): not done. The asset author signs it, and W-3 has no human author yet. Notes from the agent for whoever signs: no text, letters, numbers, flags, emblems, religious symbols, weapons, casino cues or team hues seen in the art; the expression is friendly; the costume cues are regional dress, not a uniform or a symbol
- Cultural review: not done. W-7 asks for it by another account than the author's (docs/localization.md 6.1)

Proposed for the admin draft, not decided: rarity `common`, source `default`. A `default` source makes the item a built-in static that every account owns (`docs/cosmetics.md` section 5).

## Embedded C2PA manifest

`concept/20261114-01.png` carries a C2PA manifest in a `caBX` PNG chunk. Read as text on 2026-11-14; the signature was not validated with a C2PA tool.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Action | `c2pa.created`, 2026-11-14T10:52:55Z |
| Software agent | `ChatGPT`, version `gpt-image` |
| Digital source type | `trainedAlgorithmicMedia` (IPTC) |
| Further actions | `c2pa.converted`, `c2pa.watermarked.unbound`, same time |
| Claim generator | `OpenAI Media Service API` |
| Signer | OpenAI OpCo, LLC |

The prompt was sent at 10:52:42 UTC on 2026-11-14 (agent clock), shortly before `c2pa.created`.

## Clean-up (W-3) and export (W-5)

Run on 2026-11-14 by Claude Code with Python 3.12.10, NumPy 2.4.6, SciPy 1.15.3 and Pillow 12.1.1, from the repository root:

```bash
python -I assets-src/cosmetic/avatar/silk_weaver/work/silk_weaver_cleanup.py silk_weaver assets-src/cosmetic/avatar/silk_weaver/concept/20261114-01.png assets-src/cosmetic/avatar/silk_weaver/work assets-src/cosmetic/avatar/silk_weaver/export
```

It printed background `[203.0, 203.0, 203.0]`, crop `(64, 0, 1142, 1078)`, canvas 512. A second run into an empty folder wrote byte-identical files.

| Step of `docs/asset-workflow.md` 5.1 | Done | How, or what is missing |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Background, trim, class canvas and pivot | Yes, canvas open | The flat grey background is the median of a 6 px border strip. Pixels within 30 of it (RGB distance) that connect to the top, left or right edge are background, opened by 3 px; the largest subject part is kept, its holes filled, eroded by 2 px and feathered (Gaussian sigma 1), and edge pixels are unmixed from the grey. Crop: a square of 0.86 of the shorter side, centred on the head (the top 35% of the subject), 7% headroom, clamped to the image. Canvas 512 x 512 with a circular alpha (1.5 px soft edge), because the portrait is shown in a circle (`docs/art-direction.md` 5.1); the class canvas is open (O-6) |
| 2. Paint-over, AI artefacts | No | No paint-over. Hair edges keep a thin light rim where the painted rim light and the grey background meet; an artist cleans the edge |
| 3. Moving parts on their own layers | Not needed | Static item |
| 4. Nothing art-direction section 8 forbids | Checked by the agent | No text, glow, drop shadow, rarity colour or team hue seen |
| 5. Silhouette and smallest-size tests | In part | The agent looked at the static as a filled silhouette and at 256, 120, 96 and 64 px on `color.background.base`, `color.surface.default` and `color.surface.raised`; face and expression read at 64 px. The smallest display size and frame band of an avatar are open (#168, O-6), so the test is not final |

`npm run asset:check -- assets-src/cosmetic/avatar/silk_weaver`: 1 sprite, ASTC 6x6 estimate 118,336 bytes, no limit set for a static avatar (O-5).

Not done: W-6. `npm run asset:add` refuses the item until the Cultural review line above ends in `approved`, so nothing is copied to `client/Assets/Cosmetics/` and no Unity import was run.

Prompt of `concept/20261114-01.png`, verbatim:

```text
Original 2D game art for an all-ages mobile game with a premium, aristocratic look. Painted, semi-realistic rendering with soft volume and rich materials: polished gold and brass, ivory, deep lacquer, gemstone, crystal, silk and wool. Fine ornament inside a clear, readable outer shape. One warm light from above. No text, letters, numbers, logos, flags, emblems or religious symbols. No weapons. No glow, no drop shadow, no cast shadow, no background scenery. Isolated on a plain flat light grey background that does not appear anywhere in the subject. Painted splash-art head and shoulders portrait of a young woman in her early twenties with light olive skin, dark brown hair in two long braids, a burgundy velvet headband set with small pearls and a high-collared silk dress with gold braid trim, face centred, looking slightly toward the viewer, friendly expression, rich costume detail. Keep the outer band of the image empty of anything essential.
```

RC-2 against this prompt and the Inputs line: it names no artist, studio, game, brand, mascot, logo or real person, and no image was uploaded. Checked by Claude Code on 2026-11-14.
