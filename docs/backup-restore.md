# Backup, restore and disaster plan

What is backed up, how often, where it goes, how fast it comes back, and how that is proved (#188). Decision record: ADR 0013. Hosting: Hetzner, Germany (`docs/privacy.md` section 2, ADR 0010). Release gate: GN-15 in `docs/launch-runbook.md`.

## 1. What each store holds

| Store | Holds | Loss means | Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | Accounts, ledger, purchases, inventory, ranks, pass progress, matches, promo codes, admin config and its snapshots (ADR 0005) | Money-like data lost. Not acceptable | Continuous WAL archiving plus daily base backup (section 3) |
| Redis | Only ephemeral and rebuildable state (section 4) | Players requeue and reconnect; no balance or purchase is touched | No persistence, no backup |
| Object store, content bucket | Addressables bundles, catalogs, admin-uploaded cosmetic assets (`docs/content-delivery.md`) | Broken downloads; admin-uploaded assets are not reproducible from a build | Versioning plus a daily copy to a mirror bucket (section 5) |
| Object store, state bucket | OpenTofu state (ADR 0010) | Infrastructure cannot be changed safely | Bucket versioning (already required by ADR 0010) |
| Secrets, WAL-G encryption key | `docs/environments.md` section 3 | Backups unreadable | Section 3.4 |

## 2. Targets

| Target | Value | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| RPO, PostgreSQL | 5 minutes of committed writes | `archive_timeout = 60` ships a WAL segment at least once a minute, so a lost database host costs about 1 to 2 minutes of writes in practice; 5 minutes leaves room for archive retries and a slow upload. A purchase inside that window is recovered from the store receipt history (section 7.3), never by guessing |
| RTO, PostgreSQL | 1 hour from the decision to restore until the servers take traffic | Base backup download plus WAL replay for a launch-size database takes minutes (the drill measures it, section 8); the rest is provisioning a node, the post-restore steps and verification. The game has no value while the database is down, so a tight target is cheap to hold |
| RPO, Redis | Not applicable | Nothing in it is authoritative |
| RTO, Redis | 15 minutes | Start an empty instance; pods reconnect on their own, leaderboards rebuild from PostgreSQL on first read |
| RPO, content bucket | 24 hours | The mirror is daily; anything newer is re-uploaded from the build or the admin panel |
| RTO, content bucket | 4 hours | Point the CDN origin at the mirror; no data movement |
| Whole-region loss | Out of scope at launch | One region (ADR 0010 phase 1). The backup bucket is in another Hetzner location than the database, so the data survives; rebuilding the cluster from OpenTofu is the 4 to 8 hour path. Revisit with phase 2 |

Targets are reviewed after every drill. A drill result worse than the target is a defect, not a footnote.

## 3. PostgreSQL

### 3.1 Mechanism
- WAL archiving: `archive_mode = on`, `archive_timeout = 60`, `archive_command = 'wal-g wal-push %p'` (`deploy/k8s/backup/walg-config.yaml`, ConfigMap `postgres-archive-config`).
- Base backup: CronJob `walg-base-backup`, daily 02:17 UTC, `wal-g backup-push /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata` as role `walg` over TLS. It only reads the data volume and is pinned to the node of the PostgreSQL pod with pod affinity.
- Compression `zstd`. Encryption on the client with libsodium (`WALG_LIBSODIUM_KEY`, 32 bytes, hex).
- Storage: an S3-compatible bucket used for backups only, in a different Hetzner location than the database, with its own access key that the game servers and the admin API never hold.

### 3.2 Retention
- `BackupRetentionDays` = 35 (key defined in `docs/privacy.md` section 4). CronJob `walg-retention` runs `wal-g delete retain FULL 35` daily, which removes base backups beyond 35 and the WAL they alone needed. The recovery window is therefore 35 days.
- 35 is the 30-day rights-request clock plus a 5-day margin. A backup older than that must not exist, because a deleted account would come back with it.
- Size is checked after the first month; if the bucket cost is out of proportion the window is shortened by changing this number here and in `walg-retention.yaml` together.

### 3.3 Monitoring and alerts (wired by #28)
- `pg_stat_archiver.failed_count` increasing, or `last_archived_time` older than 5 minutes: page. A stuck archive fills the data volume with WAL.
- No successful `backup-push` in 26 hours: page.
- `wal-g backup-list` (printed by the retention job) is the weekly human check; the T-1d runbook line "Backups verified fresh" is this list.

### 3.4 Keys and access
- Names only, never values: Secret `walg-credentials` (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `WALG_LIBSODIUM_KEY`, `PG_WALG_PASSWORD`), Secret `postgres-superuser` (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, used only to initialize an empty volume and for break-glass access), Secret `postgres-tls` (`tls.crt`, `tls.key`, type `kubernetes.io/tls`) and Secret `content-mirror-credentials`.
- `PG_WALG_PASSWORD` is the password of role `walg`. The initdb script sets it once; rotating it is `ALTER ROLE walg PASSWORD` first, then the Secret.
- The encryption key is also escrowed offline (the owner's and the server lead's password vaults). Without it every backup is unreadable; losing every copy equals losing the backups.
- The PostgreSQL role `walg` has only what `backup-push` needs (section 3.5). The local drill uses the superuser because its database is throwaway; the CI cluster test of section 8.1 uses role `walg`.

### 3.5 The PostgreSQL workload
Manifests: `deploy/k8s/postgres`, applied with `kubectl apply -k` together with `deploy/k8s/backup`, which holds the WAL-G and archive ConfigMaps it reads.

- StatefulSet `postgres`, one replica, pod label `app.kubernetes.io/name: postgres` (the label the base backup's pod affinity selects). A StatefulSet, not a Deployment, because it never starts a second pod while the old one may still run, so two servers can never write the same data directory, even when a node stops responding. ADR 0010's reasons against a StatefulSet apply to the game servers, not to a single database.
- PVC `postgres-data` is a standalone claim, not a `volumeClaimTemplate`, so it keeps the name the CronJobs mount, survives deleting the StatefulSet, and a restore (section 7) swaps in a new volume by creating one object of that name. Storage class: the cluster default (Hetzner volumes, encrypted at rest by the IaC of #25). `PGDATA` is the `pgdata` directory inside the volume, because a fresh volume's root is not empty.
- Service `postgres` on port 5432: `postgres.hypedomino.svc`, the host in `HD_DATABASE_URL` and in `walg-config`.
- Settings: an initdb script (`deploy/k8s/postgres/initdb/10-hypedomino.sh`, ConfigMap `postgres-initdb`) adds `include_dir = '/etc/postgresql/conf.d'` to `postgresql.conf` on the first start, and the pod mounts ConfigMaps `postgres-archive-config` (section 3.1) and `postgres-config` (TLS) there. The line lives in the data directory, so a restored data directory keeps it. TLS uses the key pair in Secret `postgres-tls`; clients connect with `sslmode=require`.
- The same script creates role `walg` with `pg_read_all_settings` and `EXECUTE` on `pg_backup_start` and `pg_backup_stop`, which is all `backup-push` needs (proved by the CI job of section 8.1). It runs only on an empty volume; the runtime and migration roles of `docs/environments.md` M-7 are created by the provisioning of #25.
- Runs as UID 999 with a read-only root filesystem, no privilege escalation, all capabilities dropped and the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile; the socket, `/tmp` and `/dev/shm` are `emptyDir` volumes.
- Probes use `pg_isready` over TCP, so the init process (socket only) never counts as ready. The startup probe allows 1 hour, the RTO of section 2, for WAL replay after a restore. `preStop` runs `pg_ctl stop -m fast`, because Kubernetes sends `SIGTERM`, which in PostgreSQL waits for every client to disconnect.
- Requests 500m CPU and 1 GiB, limit 2 GiB memory, volume 20 GiB: starting values, set from the load test (#192) and the measured WAL volume (section 8.2). No `PodDisruptionBudget`: with one replica it would block every node drain; maintenance of the database node is a planned short outage.

### 3.6 The image
- `ghcr.io/alievs-corp/hypedomino-postgres-walg`, built from `tools/backup-drill/Dockerfile` by workflow `.github/workflows/postgres-walg-image.yml` on every push to `main` that changes the Dockerfile, and on demand (`workflow_dispatch` on `main`). It uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write`; nothing is pushed from a pull request or a laptop. linux/amd64 only, like the WAL-G release binary.
- Two tags per build: the commit SHA (immutable) and the stable tag `<PostgreSQL major>-walg-<WAL-G version>`, today `16-walg-v3.0.9`, printed by `tools/backup-drill/image-tag.sh`.
- The manifests in `deploy/k8s/postgres` and `deploy/k8s/backup` reference the stable tag. CI fails if they reference anything else, so changing the PostgreSQL major or the WAL-G version changes the Dockerfile and both kustomizations in one PR.
- A rebuild with the same versions (a base image security update) moves the stable tag; a running pod keeps its image until it restarts. An environment overlay that must not move pins the digest printed in the workflow summary (`images[].digest` in its kustomization), and a rollback uses the previous SHA tag.

## 4. Redis persistence policy

What Redis holds in this code (`server/internal`):

| Data | Package | Authoritative copy | After total loss |
|---|---|---|---|
| Room routing, node registry | `cluster` | Memory of the pods, re-registered by heartbeat | Pods re-register within `HD_NODE_TTL` |
| Matchmaking tickets, leader locks, placement | `matchqueue` | The client's queue request | Players requeue |
| Presence | `friends` | The open WebSocket | Rebuilt as clients heartbeat |
| Lobby invites and joins | `lobbynet` | Short-lived messages | Lost invites are re-sent by the player |
| Leaderboards | `leaderboard` | PostgreSQL (`Rebuild`, run by `ensure` when a board is missing) | Rebuilt lazily from PostgreSQL |
| Rate-limit buckets | `ratelimit` | None | Buckets refill; a short burst of extra requests is possible |
| Sign-in and attestation nonces | `auth`, `integrity` | None | One replay inside the nonce TTL is possible after a loss; bounded by the token's own expiry and accepted |

Policy:
- `save ""` and `appendonly no`: no RDB, no AOF, no backup. A restored snapshot is worse than an empty instance because it brings back routes to pods that no longer exist, queue tickets of players who left, and presence of offline accounts.
- `maxmemory-policy noeviction`: a full instance refuses writes visibly instead of silently dropping a lock or a route.
- Config: `deploy/k8s/backup/redis-config.yaml`.
- A Redis restart or loss is an availability incident (players requeue), not a data incident. Review rule for any new use of Redis: if its loss would lose money or progress, the data belongs in PostgreSQL. Making Redis state authoritative requires changing this section and ADR 0005 first.

## 5. Object storage
- Content bucket: versioning on; CronJob `content-mirror` runs `rclone copy --immutable` daily into a mirror bucket in another location. `--immutable` fails loudly if a published key changed, which `docs/content-delivery.md` CD-3 forbids anyway. Remotes `content` and `mirror` are defined through `RCLONE_CONFIG_*` variables in Secret `content-mirror-credentials`, together with `CONTENT_BUCKET` and `MIRROR_BUCKET`.
- Hashed bundles and catalogs are reproducible from a tagged client build (`.github/workflows/release-build.yml`); the mirror matters most for admin-uploaded assets.
- The backup and mirror buckets are never writable by the game servers or the admin API.

## 6. Disaster scenarios

| Scenario | Detect | Action | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Database host or volume lost | `/readyz` fails, alert | Section 7.1 | RTO 1 h, RPO 5 min |
| Bad migration or deploy corrupted data | Support reports, ledger reconciliation | Section 7.2 to a time just before the change | RTO 1 h, writes after that time are lost |
| Ledger mistake (wrong grant) | Support, audit | Not a restore. Correct with a compensating ledger entry (`docs/admin.md` AP-1) | Minutes |
| Redis lost | Presence and queues empty | Section 7.4 | RTO 15 min |
| Backup bucket unavailable | Archive alert | PostgreSQL keeps running and queues WAL on disk; fix before the data volume reaches 50 percent | Hours |
| Backup bucket compromised | Provider alert, audit | Rotate keys and treat as a breach (`docs/launch-runbook.md` section 6); data is encrypted and the key is held elsewhere | Per runbook |
| Region lost | Provider status | Out of scope at launch (section 2) | Hours to days |

## 7. Restore runbook

Decision: the incident commander with the product owner (`docs/launch-runbook.md` section 5.4 and 6). A restore always goes to a new node and a new volume; the damaged one is kept untouched until the restore is verified.

### 7.1 Restore to the latest state
1. Stop the game servers (scale the Deployment to 0). Writes during a restore would be lost or double-applied.
2. Provision the replacement PostgreSQL node and an empty data volume.
3. `wal-g backup-list` shows what exists; fetch the newest: `wal-g backup-fetch $PGDATA LATEST`.
4. `touch $PGDATA/recovery.signal`; start PostgreSQL with `restore_command = 'wal-g wal-fetch %f %p'` and `recovery_target_action = promote` (no target means replay to the end of the archive).
5. Wait until `pg_is_in_recovery()` is false.
6. Continue at section 7.3.

### 7.2 Restore to a point in time
Same as 7.1, adding `recovery_target_time = '<UTC timestamp>'` in step 4. Pick the time from the audit log of the bad change, minus a margin. A time chosen too early is repaired by restoring again with a later one, because base backups and WAL are not consumed by a restore. `recovery_target_inclusive` stays at its default. The local drill performs exactly this procedure.

### 7.3 After every restore, before traffic
1. Re-apply account deletions completed after the restore point (`docs/privacy.md` section 8.2 step 5, L-19). The source is a deletion log that survives the restore; it does not exist yet (section 9).
2. Reconcile purchases after the restore point: ask the stores for the transactions since that time and run them through the normal idempotent grant path (a receipt already recorded is a no-op, ADR 0007). This repairs the RPO window.
3. Reconcile ledger sums against balances and check the schema version (`docs/environments.md` M-5).
4. Empty Redis (section 7.4); stale routing must not outlive a restore.
5. Scale the servers up; confirm `/readyz`, one sign-in, one match, one store sandbox purchase.
6. Take a fresh base backup at once, so the new timeline has a restore point of its own.
7. Write the incident record: times, target, writes lost, who decided.

### 7.4 Redis
Start an empty instance with `deploy/k8s/backup/redis-config.yaml`; restart the game pods so they re-register their nodes and rooms.

### 7.5 Content bucket
Point the CDN origin at the mirror bucket; re-upload anything newer from the release build or the admin panel.

## 8. Restore drill

### 8.1 Local drill
`bash tools/backup-drill/drill.sh` needs only Docker. It:
1. starts an S3-compatible object store (SeaweedFS, standing in for the Hetzner bucket) and creates the bucket;
2. starts PostgreSQL 16 with WAL archiving through WAL-G, compressed and encrypted as in production;
3. writes 1000 rows, takes a base backup, writes 500 rows, records a target time, writes 250 more rows, and forces the WAL to be archived;
4. destroys the database and restores into a fresh volume from the base backup and WAL with `recovery_target_time` set to the recorded time;
5. fails unless exactly the 1000 base rows and the 500 replayed rows exist, none of the 250 later rows exist, and the database accepts writes after promotion.

It prints the restore time. CI job `backup-drill` runs it on every change to `tools/backup-drill`, `deploy/k8s/backup`, `deploy/k8s/postgres` or the workflow. The same job renders both kustomizations and validates them against the Kubernetes schema (kubeconform), checks that they reference the image tag of section 3.6, and runs `tools/backup-drill/kind-postgres.sh` on a kind cluster: it applies both kustomizations with test Secrets and an in-cluster object store, waits for the StatefulSet to be ready, checks that the archive and TLS settings are active, runs Jobs created from `walg-base-backup` and `walg-retention`, and fails unless WAL was archived and the base backup is listed. First run on 2026-11-12: 1500 rows restored, 0 after the target, fetch, replay and promote in about 6 seconds for the toy database, about 35 seconds end to end.

### 8.2 Staging drill (open)
Not possible until staging exists (#25). Procedure to run then, recorded as GN-15 evidence:
1. Load a production-sized synthetic dataset on staging (`docs/test-strategy.md` 7.2) and let it run 24 hours so base backups and WAL exist in the real backup bucket.
2. Declare a restore: stop the servers, run section 7.2 against the real bucket on a new node, start the clock.
3. Run section 7.3, including the deletion step.
4. Record RTO from the declaration to the first successful match, RPO from the last restored write, the base backup size and WAL volume per day, and every manual step not in this document.
5. Correct this document and the targets from what was measured.

### 8.3 Cadence
- Local drill: every change to the files above.
- Staging drill: before launch (GN-15), then every quarter and after any change of PostgreSQL major version, WAL-G version or hosting.
- Backup freshness: weekly (`wal-g backup-list`) and at T-1d before a release.

## 9. Open items
- Staging restore drill and measured RTO (needs staging, #25). Part of #188.
- A deletion log that survives a restore, so 7.3 step 1 can be executed. Today a deletion is a state change in PostgreSQL (`server/internal/account/deletion.go`) and is lost with the data it was written to. Proposal: append each completed deletion (tombstone id, time) to an object in the backup bucket. Tracked in #601; L-19 stays open until then.
- Real bucket, endpoint, credentials, encryption key, TLS key pair, superuser and `walg` passwords, and mirror bucket (owner provides, section 3.4).
- The first push of the image happens when the workflow of section 3.6 first runs on `main`. If the package stays private, the clusters need an image pull secret for `ghcr.io` (#25).
- Storage class, volume size and resource values confirmed on staging (#25, #192).
- Alerts of section 3.3 (#28).
